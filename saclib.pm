# Meaning of LCALDA from http://www.llnl.gov/sac/SAC_Manuals/FileFormatPt2.html
# LCALDA is TRUE if DIST, AZ, BAZ, and GCARC are to be calculated from
# station and event coordinates; this is you set these to some other value,
# need to make sure that LCALDA is FALSE if you want SAC itself to find it.
# Self-made programs of course that query the header will return it anyway.
# However, I have not found of way of setting the variable to a logical yet.
